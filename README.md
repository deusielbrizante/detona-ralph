# Game Whack a Ralph

## Game developed alongside DIO's challenge "PotÃªncia Tech iFood - Game Development"

<br>
The initial part of the project was developed with the teacher, where Ralph appears and disappears and we have to get him right to score.

## Additions made to the project

### Player life mechanics

<br>
The life system was developed based on the player's clicking errors, where a check was implemented to see if it was already clicked correctly in the current round before Ralph disappeared so that the error does not count and another check to see if the player clicked wrong this round before hitting Ralph, that way you can count several mistakes until you hit him.

### Game over or timeout screen

<br>
The menu was developed with the aim of improving the quality of the game for the player. We added a button to it that restarts the game when clicked, changing its variables to their initial state. We've also added the current score to make it more visible and your best score since the page was loaded, changing the text from "Game Over" to "Time Stopped" if time runs out and a "New Record" message if you got a new record.
